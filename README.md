# Flight Status App

## Overview

This repository contains the solution to the Indigo Airlines Fleet Management case study. The objective was to analyze and improve the operational efficiency of Indigo Airlines' fleet management system.

## Objectives

- Analyze flight schedules, maintenance records, crew schedules, and fuel consumption data.
- Provide actionable recommendations to enhance operational efficiency.
- Develop an implementation plan for the proposed solutions.

## Solution

### Data Collection
- Extracted and cleaned data from various sources including flight schedules, maintenance records, crew schedules, and fuel consumption logs.

### Data Analysis
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns.
- Utilized statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to forecast flight delays and maintenance needs.

### Recommendations
- **Predictive Maintenance:** Proposed a new maintenance schedule using machine learning models to predict maintenance needs.
- **Crew Scheduling:** Suggested optimization strategies for crew schedules to reduce turnaround times.
- **Fuel Management:** Recommended strategies to manage fuel consumption more efficiently.

### Implementation Plan
- Developed a comprehensive plan for integrating the predictive maintenance system with existing tools.
- Provided a timeline and cost estimates for the implementation phase.
